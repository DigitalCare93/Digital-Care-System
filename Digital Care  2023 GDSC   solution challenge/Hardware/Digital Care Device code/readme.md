# Digital care device:
It is a device used to measure the vital signs of the human body and sends the vital signs to a mobile application that is placed in the wrist and the sensor is connected to the sensitive finger for measuring heart rate and oxygen saturation and the other sensor is placed at the bottom of the device so that it is connected to the wrist and it is necessary To be at a distance in the sensor and the human body a very short distance

# The physical side of the project will now be explained

## Tools used in the device
### 1-	Interfacing MAX30102 Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor: 

The MAX30102 pulse oximeter and heart rate sensor is an I2C-based low-power plug-and-play biometric sensor. It can be used by students, hobbyists, engineers, manufacturers, and game & mobile developers who want to incorporate live heart-rate data into their projects.
The module features the MAX30102 – a modern (the successor to the MAX30100), integrated pulse oximeter and heart rate sensor IC, from Analog Devices. It combines two LEDs, a photodetector, optimized optics, and low-noise analog signal processing to detect pulse oximetry (SpO2) and heart rate (HR) signals.

 ### 2- Interface MLX90614 Non-contact Infrared Temperature Sensor: 
 
 Since the emergence of COVID-19, non-contact infrared temperature scanners have been popping up everywhere around the world, from airports to restaurants. Maybe you are curious about these temperature scanners, or maybe you’re interested in building one. Well, in that case, the Melexis MLX90614 Module might be the best inexpensive option out there.

### 3- ESP32 Development Board :

The ESP32 is a series of low-cost and low-power System on a Chip (SoC) microcontrollers developed by Espressif that include Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless capabilities and dual-core processor. If you’re familiar with the ESP8266, the ESP32 is its successor, loaded with lots of new features.
